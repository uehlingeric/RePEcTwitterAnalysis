# RePEc Twitter Activity and Social Media Migration Analysis

This project is a research collaboration between Eric Uehling and Dr. Kwok Ping Tsang from the Virginia Tech Economics Department. The study examines the behavior of RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) users on Twitter, particularly focusing on the impact of Elon Musk’s takeover of the platform. We also analyze a brief migration of RePEc users to Mastodon, as observed through their discussions on Twitter, and their eventual return to the platform.

## Overview

The project aims to understand how RePEc users—primarily economists, researchers, and academics—utilize Twitter to engage with the broader community. RePEc is a well-known platform that hosts working papers, journal articles, books, and software components related to economics. Economists who contribute to RePEc often use Twitter for sharing research, engaging in discussions, and building their professional networks.

The research investigates how the Twitter landscape shifted following Elon Musk’s acquisition and the subsequent uncertainty around platform changes. While many RePEc users, like other professionals, discussed alternatives like Mastodon on Twitter during this period, we focus solely on Twitter data to track their engagement. This analysis tracks how these users reacted, how their Twitter activity changed, and how they eventually resumed normal activity.

By analyzing tweet data and user activity before, during, and after the Twitter takeover, this project uncovers patterns related to user engagement, sentiment, and migration behaviors based on discussions around Mastodon.

## Notebooks Overview

### 1. RePEc Tweets EDA
**File**: `RePEc_Tweets_EDA.ipynb`  
This notebook performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on tweets from RePEc users. The focus is on understanding the distribution of tweet engagement (likes, retweets, replies) and how users interact with one another through the platform.

### 2. XCorp Timeline
**File**: `Xcorp_Timeline.ipynb`  
This notebook analyzes the timeline of Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and its transition to XCorp. The goal is to identify key events and their impact on RePEc users’ Twitter activity, such as notable drops or spikes in engagement during critical moments of the acquisition process.

### 3. Seasonal Regression
**File**: `Seasonal_Regression.ipynb`  
This notebook examines the seasonality of RePEc users’ tweet patterns. By analyzing tweet counts over time, we aim to distinguish between normal seasonal fluctuations and the irregular drop in activity following Elon Musk’s takeover of Twitter.

### 4. RePEc User Info EDA
**File**: `RePEc_UserInfo_EDA.ipynb`  
This notebook analyzes the demographic and engagement metrics of RePEc users, such as follower count, tweet frequency, and user verification status. It provides insights into the types of RePEc contributors active on Twitter and how their engagement evolves over time.

### 5. Mastodon Analysis
**File**: `Mastodon_Analysis.ipynb`  
This notebook tracks the discussions of Mastodon on Twitter, analyzing the frequency and sentiment of Mastodon mentions in tweets over time. It also includes a comparative analysis of tweets mentioning Elon Musk to understand how discussions surrounding these two subjects overlap.

### 6. Mastodon Exposure
**File**: `Mastodon_Exposure.ipynb`  
This notebook delves deeper into the interactions of RePEc users, focusing on how their social networks evolved during the brief Mastodon migration period. Although Mastodon is discussed, the data is based solely on Twitter activity, particularly user mentions of Mastodon, and their eventual return to Twitter.

## RePEc and Twitter: Context and User Behavior

RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) is a vast collaborative effort among hundreds of volunteers in over 100 countries, providing a decentralized database of working papers, journal articles, books, chapters, and software components related to economics. Contributors to RePEc are typically researchers, economists, professors, and academics who share their research findings through the platform.

These contributors also leverage Twitter as a tool for:
- **Sharing Research**: Posting links to their latest publications, papers, and articles.
- **Engaging in Discussions**: Contributing to debates on economic topics, policy discussions, and real-time economic issues.
- **Building Networks**: Connecting with fellow researchers, institutions, and the public to broaden their professional reach.

The project explores how this group reacted to the uncertainties surrounding Twitter after Elon Musk’s acquisition. Many users discussed alternatives like Mastodon on Twitter during this time, but most RePEc users eventually returned to Twitter due to its unmatched reach and established networks.
